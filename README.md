# GeekCamp_FOSS_Task2
In Task 2, You don't have to do anything in Main Branch
you have two subtasks: Subtask-1, and Subtask-2.

1)Checkout to **Subtask-1** branch

● In the Subtask-1 branch, there is a dialogue.txt file.
   There you have to write two lines-
   In first line, your name and enrolment number
   In second line, your favorite movie dialogue
   
2)Checkout to **Subtask-2**  branch

● In the branch named Subtask-2, there is a movie folder.
   There you have to create a <githubusername>.txt file where you have to write your favorite movie name.

● Now, while doing these tasks, you have to make sure that you solve all the merge conflicts, if any present, & hence you will be asked again & again to do the same.
